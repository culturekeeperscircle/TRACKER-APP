Executive Order 14189: Celebrating America's 250th Birthday,1/29/2025,Active,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/03/2025-02231/celebrating-americas-250th-birthday,Executive,"Dept. of Interior, Smithsonian, Kennedy Center, Corp. for Public Broadcast",Advisory Council on Historic Preservation,Censorship,"People, Places, Practices, Treasures (Artifacts/Artwork)","The Executive Order (EO): Celebrating America's 250th Birthday affects the documentation of U.S.-based African-descendant, Indigenous, Latiné, Asian, and Pacific Islander communities by mandating that federal commemorations and activities focus on a singular, celebratory narrative of the nation's founding and history, potentially marginalizing or omitting accounts of struggle, resistance, and non-European contributions. The EO establishes the White House Task Force on Celebrating America's 250th Birthday (Task Force 250) and directs federal agencies to shape the commemoration around specific themes that affect historical practice:
Emphasis on ""Founding Principles and Ideals"": The EO steers the celebration towards ""instilling a sense of informed patriotism,"" ""uplifting public monuments that remind Americans of our extraordinary heritage,"" and ""consistent progress toward becoming a more perfect Union.""
Marginalization of Complex History: This framing encourages the minimization or exclusion of historical accounts that highlight systemic injustices, such as slavery, forced relocation of Indigenous peoples, segregation, and discriminatory immigration laws. These struggles are central to the contributions and experiences of African-descendant, Indigenous, Latiné, and Asian/Pacific Islander communities.
Limiting Federal Support: Federal funding and official programming are likely to be prioritized for projects that align with the celebratory, unifying narrative, thereby reducing resources for historical practices that emphasize complexity, dissent, or multiculturalism.
Prioritizing Certain Monuments: The focus on ""uplifting public monuments"" suggests a prioritization of existing federal sites and memorials that typically represent the traditional, white-male narrative of American leadership. This could lead to disproportionate funding for these sites over places and treasures that document the history of minority communities (e.g., sites related to the Civil Rights Movement, Chinatowns, or Native American historic preservation).
Exclusion of Cultural Assets: While the EO doesn't explicitly ban documenting these communities, the thematic mandate limits the types of ""treasure"" (historical artifacts, cultural programs, or exhibits) that receive official federal endorsement and promotion for the 250th anniversary. Exhibits that focus on the contributions of these groups must likely be framed solely within the context of ""progress"" toward the nation's stated ideals, rather than as separate or critical narratives.
In essence, the order directs a federal practice of selective history, celebrating achievements within a limited framework that can overshadow the full, diverse, and often challenging historical contributions of U.S.-based African-descendant, Indigenous, Latiné, Asian, and Pacific Islander communities.",,,,,,
Executive Order 14224: Designating English as the Official Language of The United States,3/1/2025,Active,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/06/2025-03694/designating-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states,Executive,,,Censorship,"People, Practices","The Executive Order: Designating English as the Official Language of the United States significantly impacts U.S.-based African-descendant, Indigenous, Latiné, Asian, and Pacific Islander communities by directly threatening language access to essential government services and devaluing their linguistic heritage. The primary mechanism is the revocation of Executive Order 13166 (Clinton-era), which previously required federal agencies to develop plans to ensure meaningful access for individuals with Limited English Proficiency (LEP). While the order does not ban agencies from offering multilingual services, the removal of the mandate and the new focus on ""minimizing"" such services will inevitably lead to a reduction in translated materials and support, effectively making English the practical requirement for full participation in federal programs. // The core impact of designating English as the official language affects people and practices by severely diminishing access to essential government services. By revoking Executive Order 13166, which mandated proactive language assistance for those with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), the new order shifts policy from required services to optional ones. This creates immediate practical barriers for the millions of LEP individuals, who are disproportionately from Latiné and Asian/Pacific Islander communities, in accessing critical areas like healthcare, legal proceedings, disaster relief, and civic engagement. Furthermore, the symbolic elevation of English as necessary for a ""unified and cohesive society"" risks stigmatizing and increasing hostility toward non-English speakers, leading to social exclusion and discrimination within the affected communities. // The effect on places and treasures centers on the devaluation of linguistic heritage. By revoking the requirement for language assistance, the Executive Order implicitly signals that non-English languages—such as Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, and various Indigenous languages—are not priorities for federal resources. This poses a direct threat to tribal sovereignty and efforts to revitalize Native American languages, as language is vital to Indigenous identity and the documentation of their culture. For all non-English speaking communities, minimizing the investment in multilingual services reduces the capacity of federal institutions (which hold many national treasures) to accurately and inclusively document and express the rich cultural contributions and histories of U.S.-based African-descendant, Indigenous, Latiné, Asian, and Pacific Islander communities in their native tongues.",,,,,,
